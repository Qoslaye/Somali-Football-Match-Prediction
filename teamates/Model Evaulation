What is Model Evaluation?
Model evaluation is the process of assessing how well your trained models perform on unseen data (the test set). For classification tasks like yours, we use metrics such as:

Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions.

Confusion Matrix: A table showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

Classification Report: Includes precision, recall, and F1-score for each class (Win, Draw, Loss).
